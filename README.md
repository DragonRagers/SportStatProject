# Sports Statistics Project: Live League of Legends Game Predictor

I plan to create a (hopefully) live predictor of the chances of a team winning in a League of Legends game based off of things like gold advantage, turrets taken, current dragons, and other in game information.

## Getting Data
Data of games is being pulled from official Riot Games API: https://developer.riotgames.com/, specifically I implement a wrapper created by pseudonym117 which can be found here: https://github.com/pseudonym117/Riot-Watcher. Currently I am using a development API key which must be regenerated every 24 hours but once this project is done I will likely apply for a permenant project key.
